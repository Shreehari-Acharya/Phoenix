## Mission Objectives completed
- âœ… Gadget Inventory `(/gadgets)`
    - `GET`: Retrieve a list of all gadgets.

    - `PATCH`: Update an existing gadget's information.
    - `DELETE`: Remove a gadget from the inventory.
- Self-Destruct Sequence `(/gadgets/{id}/self-destruct)`

## Bonus Features implemented
